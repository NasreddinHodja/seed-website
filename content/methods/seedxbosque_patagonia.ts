      Growing the seeds from a partnership that started in 2024,, S.E.E.D (BR) and Bosque Gracias (ARG) 
      proposed  an art residency that seeks to unite the creative ecosystems of the two global south 
      Web3 collectives.
      `,
      `
      Aiming to create a space for artistic and cultural exchange between distinct contexts, 
      this was the third residency project proposed by S.E.E.D, solidifying the collaboration with 
      Bosque Gracias that had begun in 2024 in S√£o Paulo, followed by a second edition in Belo Horizonte.
      `,
      `
      The residency took place in Patagonia, where Bosque Gracias, receiving 14 Artists from Brazil, 
      carried out its activities immersed in the forest, reinforcing its commitment to regenerative 
      living in harmony with nature. This was combined with S.E.E.D‚Äôs expertise in cyber, urban, and 
      Brazilian culture to create a unique synergy that bridged the organic and the digital, blending 
      ancestral wisdom with cutting-edge innovation in a landscape that inspired transformation and 
      creativity.
