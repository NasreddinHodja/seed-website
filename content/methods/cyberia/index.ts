      In an action of the distribution and germination process, the
      celebration called <b>Cyberia</b> was born. A meeting-party project
      promoted by <i>S.E.E.D</i>.

      Organically exploring the encounter of strange and rhythmic
      frequencies with ephemeral visual exhibitions, Cyberia serves as a
      dissemination, being able to be the first &ltIRL&gt contact of those
      captivated to affirm the intention of the seed within themselves,
      serving as a process of organic propagation of the S.E.E.D,
      infecting the unwary and serving as a affirmation for those already
      used to it.
      `,
      `            
      Inside and outside their bodies and minds, a night of CYBERIA always
      ends in daydreaming.
